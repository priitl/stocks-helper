# Feature Specification: Bulk Transaction Import

**JIRA Task**: N/A
**Feature Branch**: `002-bulk-transaction-import`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to add bulk import support for all my transactions across different brokers (swedbank, lightyear). they provide csv for everything that has happend in that account buy, sell, dividend, withdraw, conversion, distribution, conversion etc etc. we need to store these and update our porfolio based on these. i will provide the exact csv samples later."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: brokers (Swedbank, Lightyear), transaction types (buy, sell, dividend, withdraw, conversion, distribution), CSV import, portfolio updates
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí CSV format/schema per broker [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact CSV samples pending]
   ‚Üí Data validation rules [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what makes a transaction valid?]
   ‚Üí Error handling strategy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how to handle invalid rows?]
   ‚Üí Historical data handling [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what if transactions already exist?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: upload CSV ‚Üí validate ‚Üí import ‚Üí update portfolio
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Marked ambiguous requirements with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Transaction, Broker, ImportBatch
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - CSV samples pending"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarification)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: When re-importing a CSV with transactions that already exist in the system, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Skip duplicates but report them in the import summary
- Q: What field combination should identify a transaction as a duplicate? ‚Üí A: Broker's unique reference/transaction ID only
- Q: When a CSV contains invalid rows (malformed data, missing required fields), how should the import process behave? ‚Üí A: Import all valid rows that do not need manual intervention. Rows that need manual intervention need to be prompted at the end so that user can give guidance how to import them
- Q: When importing transactions in different currencies (USD, EUR, etc.), how should the system handle currency conversion? ‚Üí A: Store transactions in original currency only (no conversion). Portfolio overview must track currency conversion profit/loss separately
- Q: When importing transactions that would result in negative holdings (e.g., selling shares before any buy transactions exist), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Allow negative holdings (short positions or data reconciliation scenarios)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a portfolio owner, I need to import all historical transactions from my broker accounts (Swedbank, Lightyear) via CSV files so that my portfolio reflects accurate holdings, cost basis, and transaction history without manual data entry.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CSV file from Swedbank containing buy/sell/dividend transactions, **When** I upload the file, **Then** all valid transactions are imported and my portfolio holdings are updated accordingly
2. **Given** a CSV file from Lightyear with 100 transactions (95 valid, 5 invalid), **When** I upload it, **Then** the system imports 95 valid transactions automatically and prompts the user to provide guidance for the 5 invalid rows
3. **Given** I've already imported transactions for January 2024, **When** I upload a CSV containing those same transactions again, **Then** the system skips duplicate transactions and includes them in the import summary report with a duplicate count
4. **Given** a CSV with mixed transaction types (buy, sell, dividend, withdrawal, conversion), **When** imported, **Then** each transaction type correctly updates portfolio state
5. **Given** a CSV with mixed currencies (EUR, USD), **When** imported, **Then** transactions are stored in their original currencies and portfolio overview tracks currency conversion profit/loss separately

### Edge Cases
- CSV rows that are malformed or missing required fields are flagged for manual intervention and presented to the user at the end of the import process
- Duplicate transactions (identified by broker's unique reference ID) are skipped and counted in the import summary
- What if a CSV contains transactions for tickers not yet in the system?
- How are stock splits/reverse splits reflected in historical imports?
- Negative holdings are allowed (to support short positions or data reconciliation when historical data is incomplete)
- Partial imports are supported: valid rows are imported, invalid rows requiring manual intervention are presented to the user for guidance
- What happens with transactions dated in the future?
- How are dividend reinvestments represented vs cash dividends?

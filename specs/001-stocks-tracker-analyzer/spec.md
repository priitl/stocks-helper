## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: Market data scope: Which stock markets should the system support? ‚Üí A: US + major international (UK, EU, Asia) - requires multi-currency conversion
- Q: Stock market data source: What's your preference for data sources? ‚Üí A: Free APIs only (15-min delayed data, rate limits) - e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance
- Q: Recommendation methodology: What analysis approach should drive buy/sell/hold recommendations? ‚Üí A: Combined approach (both technical and fundamental signals)
- Q: Recommendation update frequency: How often should recommendations refresh? ‚Üí A: Daily batch (recommendations updated once per day)
- Q: New stock suggestion criteria: What should drive recommendations for stocks you don't own? ‚Üí A: Combination of diversification gaps + market opportunities, with performance tracking of similar stocks

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an individual investor, I want to track my stock portfolio in one place, receive data-driven insights about my holdings, and get actionable recommendations on whether to buy, sell, or hold my current stocks, as well as discover new investment opportunities that align with my portfolio strategy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have entered my stock holdings into the system, **When** I view my portfolio dashboard, **Then** I see current values, performance metrics, and an overview of my investments
2. **Given** I am viewing a specific stock in my portfolio, **When** the system analyzes it, **Then** I receive a recommendation (buy more, sell, or hold) with supporting rationale
3. **Given** I want to diversify my portfolio, **When** I request new stock suggestions, **Then** the system provides recommendations for stocks I don't currently own with justification, including diversification opportunities, similar stocks to my winners, and strong market opportunities
3a. **Given** my portfolio is heavily weighted in US tech stocks, **When** the system analyzes diversification gaps, **Then** it suggests stocks from underrepresented sectors (e.g., healthcare, energy) or regions (e.g., EU, Asia)
4. **Given** I have multiple stocks in my portfolio, **When** the system generates insights, **Then** I see meaningful analysis about portfolio composition, risk, and performance trends
5. **Given** I add a new stock purchase to my portfolio, **When** the transaction is recorded, **Then** my portfolio metrics update immediately and recommendations refresh during the next daily batch update
6. **Given** recommendations were last updated yesterday, **When** I view my portfolio today after the daily batch runs, **Then** I see fresh recommendations with updated timestamps

### Edge Cases
- What happens when stock market data is unavailable or the API is down during the daily batch update?
- How does the system handle API rate limit errors (e.g., maximum requests per day exceeded)?
- What happens if the daily batch job fails to complete or misses a scheduled run?
- How does the system handle stocks that have been delisted or merged?
- What recommendations are provided when there is insufficient historical data for analysis?
- How are dividends, stock splits, and other corporate actions reflected in portfolio tracking?
- What happens when exchange rates fluctuate significantly between transaction date and current valuation?
- How are currency conversion fees or exchange rate spreads reflected in performance calculations?
- What happens when free API data quality degrades or becomes unreliable?

## Next Steps

This specification has identified **13 areas requiring clarification** before implementation planning can begin. The primary areas needing decisions are:

1. **Data sources**: Real-time vs delayed data, specific market data providers, cost considerations
2. **Analysis methodology**: Technical vs fundamental analysis, specific indicators and metrics
3. **Scope boundaries**: US-only vs international stocks, currency handling
4. **Update frequency**: Real-time vs batch updates for prices and recommendations
5. **Recommendation engine**: Algorithm basis, confidence scoring methodology
6. **Portfolio features**: Corporate actions handling, dividend tracking, multi-currency support

Use `/clarify` to address these uncertainties and complete the specification.
